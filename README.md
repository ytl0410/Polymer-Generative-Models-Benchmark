# Polymer-Generative-Models-Benchmark
Well-trained models and generative outcomes for the paper "Benchmarking Study of Deep Generative Models for Inverse Polymer Design". AAE,VAE,CHarRNN, ORGAN, and REINVENT models can be found here here and GraphINVENT moddels can be found at: https://zenodo.org/records/12734266

For the application of AAE, VAE, CharRNN, and ORGAN models, please refer to https://github.com/molecularsets/moses?tab=readme-ov-file. The training scripts and related commands can be found in the `/MOSES` folder.

For the application of the REINVENT model, please refer to https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent. For the application of the GraphINVENT model, please refer to https://github.com/MolecularAI/GraphINVENT.
